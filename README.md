# Basic Concepts in Software Development: Algorithms, Libraries, Frameworks and the Internet


Today software development is a relatively uncomplicated task, given the years of accumulated knowledge about it. In this brief article we try to elucidate some concepts which can be useful to satisfy the curiosity of any beginner in the area.

# Algorithms
*What is an algorithm?*

Briefly, we can understand an algorithm as **a set of rules and instructions placed in a specific order to perform a specific task** on a computer, although not only on it. Algorithms are an everyday thing: cake recipes, schedules, market lists, all these ways of organizing actions into specific steps and orders contain the germ of what an algorithm is.

In programming, however, we have slightly more fixed rules. Before any decision about the manner or order, we need to ask ourselves: **what do we want our algorithm to do?** Bearing this in mind, then we can think of a series of logical operations whose invariable conclusion will be contained by these operations themselves.

**An algorithm is just that: this set of rules and operations.** It is not yet a program, but it comprises the sequence of variables and conditions that must be obeyed for a defined problem to be solved in a defined way.

## Libraries and Frameworks

*After all, what's the difference between the two?*

Having already a few generations of professionals and enthusiasts, programming today is no longer a solitary task done only by garage devs or elitist enthusiasts, if anything, programming has become a social enterprise. Decades of experience were ultimately condensed into vast collections of code and templates made available online. Keeping that in mind, **what is the difference between Libraries and Frameworks?**

One of the main differences between Libraries and Frameworks is that a library is a source of codes and templates that when used by a developer allow control over the flow of an application. A framework is a set of low-level rules and libraries that control the application flow when the developer is not in charge.

The definitive difference, therefore, between libraries and frameworks is in their execution level and function: **Libraries** are time-tested reusable data sets that can help to automate a program's functionality. **A Library can be used by multiple users for different purposes and can be modified at their whim.**

**A Framework**, on the other hand, is somewhat stiff: **Frameworks allow their users to create software, using it in a way delimited by the framework itself**. Frameworks are extensible, that is, they can be expanded according to the programmer's needs, however, **their code cannot be modified** - when a user uses a framework, all calls are made by the framework itself, not by the programmer. So frameworks are powerful automation tools, but not necessarily as flexible as libraries can be.
